# 👩‍💻 Daily Coding Challenges

This repository is a collection of my daily coding challenge solutions.

### 🧐 Why?

* a chance to work through different puzzles and scenarios
* daily coding helps to solidify core concepts
* what better way to deepen my understanding of the language than to use it?

### :notebook: Notes

For now my challenges are mostly [Codewars](https://codewars.com) katas. The instructions for each are in comments.

These challenges are a study tool for me, so you may see some repetition as I practice with different approaches and techniques.
